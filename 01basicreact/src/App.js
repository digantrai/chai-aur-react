/*here we have app function which returns
html and the function is exported.So, the
advantage is that we are able to use javascript to write html. 


** components like our function Chai, first letter should be capital letter. Also, first letter of file nae should be capital letter too. Some library, requires file
name to be in jsx like in Vite.
